💡 Introduction
Observability is the ability to understand a system's internal state by analyzing the data it produces—logs, metrics, and traces.

Monitoring (Metrics): Tracks system health (CPU, memory, network).
What is happening.

Logging (Logs): Captures detailed system events.
Why it is happening.

Tracing (Traces): Follows the flow of a request across services.
How it is happening.



🤔 Why Monitoring?
Monitoring ensures systems work as expected, helping maintain health, performance, and security by enabling:

✅ Early problem detection

✅ Performance measurement

✅ Availability assurance

🤔 Why Observability?
Observability allows deeper understanding of system behavior, acting like a detailed diagnostic tool to:

🔍 Diagnose issues

🔍 Understand behavior

🔍 Improve system reliability



🆚 Monitoring vs. Observability
Category	Monitoring	Observability
Focus	Is everything working?	Why is it behaving this way?
Data	Metrics (CPU, memory, error rates)	Logs, metrics, traces
Alerts	Notifies on failures	Correlates events to find root causes
Example	Alert on 90% CPU usage	Trace slow requests to find bottlenecks
Insight	Prevent issues	Diagnose and optimize system behavior

🔭 Does Observability Include Monitoring?
Yes!
Monitoring is a subset of observability. While monitoring tracks specific metrics and alerts on thresholds, observability provides a full picture by analyzing logs, metrics, and traces.

🖥️ What Can Be Monitored?
Infrastructure: CPU, memory, disk I/O, network

Applications: Response time, error rates, throughput

Databases: Query performance, connection pool, transaction rates

Network: Latency, packet loss, bandwidth

Security: Unauthorized access, firewall logs

👀 What Can Be Observed?
Logs: Detailed event records

Metrics: Quantitative system data (CPU, memory, requests)

Traces: Request flow across services

🆚 Bare-Metal vs. Kubernetes
Aspect	Bare-Metal Servers	Kubernetes
Monitoring	Easier access to hardware & logs	Challenges with dynamic containers & scaling
Observability	Simpler data collection & correlation	Complex; needs sophisticated, integrated tools

⚒️ Tools
Monitoring:
Prometheus, Grafana, Nagios, Zabbix, PRTG

Observability:
ELK/EFK Stack, Splunk, Jaeger, Zipkin, New Relic, Dynatrace, Datadog
