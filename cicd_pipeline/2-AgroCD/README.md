CI/CD Pipeline with GitLab, Helm, ArgoCD, and Kubernetes

Overview
This repository demonstrates a GitOps-based CI/CD workflow using GitLab CI, Docker Registry, Helm, ArgoCD, and Kubernetes. The process is designed to streamline application deployment from code commit to production.

Pipeline Steps
1. Commit Changes
Actor: Developer

Action: Developer commits source code and relevant configuration files (Dockerfile, .gitlab-ci.yml) to the Code Repository.

2. GitLab CI Pipeline
Trigger: Commit to the code repo.

Steps:

build_image: Docker image is built from the code.

tag_latest_image: Image is tagged appropriately (e.g., with commit SHA or latest).

update_manifest: Helm values (typically in values.yaml) are updated with the new image tag.

3. Push to Registry
Destination: Docker image is pushed to the Container Registry (e.g., DockerHub or GitLab Registry).

4. Update Manifest Repo
Action: GitLab CI updates the values.yaml or other relevant deployment configurations in the Manifest Repository.

5. Sync with ArgoCD
Tool: ArgoCD

Action: ArgoCD detects changes in the manifest repository and synchronizes them to the Kubernetes cluster.

6. Deploy to Kubernetes
Final Step: Updated application is deployed to the Kubernetes cluster using the new Helm chart values.

Benefits
Automation: Reduces manual intervention with fully automated build and deploy.

Traceability: All changes are tracked in Git.

Rollback: Reverting to a previous version is as simple as reverting a Git commit.

Declarative: Desired state is defined in manifests and managed by ArgoCD.

Prerequisites
GitLab CI/CD setup

Docker Registry (DockerHub, GitLab Container Registry, etc.)
