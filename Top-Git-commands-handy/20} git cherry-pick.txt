git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
This command takes a single commit from another branch and applies it to your current branch, as if you made that change yourself.

It’s super useful when you need a bug fix or feature from another branch but don’t want to pull in everything.

Just be mindful that cherry-picking creates a new commit with the same changes but a different hash, so it’s not identical to the original.
