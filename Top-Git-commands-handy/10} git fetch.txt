git fetch
git fetch origin
This command contacts the remote and downloads all the latest changes—new commits, branches, etc.—but it doesn’t touch your working directory.

Your current branch remains exactly the same.

If you're on the main branch and want to see what new commits are on the remote origin/main, run:

git log HEAD..origin/main

git fetch gives you full control—you fetch first, review, and only merge when you're ready.

Speaking of branches—let’s look at how to create and work with them next.
