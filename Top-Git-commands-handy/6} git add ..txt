git add
When you run git add, you’re telling Git to include this in the next snapshot.

Just editing a file isn’t enough. Git doesn’t track your changes automatically.

Until you run git add, those changes are invisible to Git when it comes time to commit.

You can stage a specific file by running git add filename:

git add filename
Or, if you want to stage everything that’s changed in the current directory, run:

git add .
git add is like packing your code changes into a box and getting them ready for delivery.

Once your changes are staged, it's time to lock them in with a commit with git commit command.
