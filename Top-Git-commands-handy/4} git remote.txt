git remote
Using git remote, you can add, view, or remove remote connections. Remote repository can be hosted anywhere like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or even your own server.

To check if your project already has any remotes configured, run:

git remote -v
This will list all the remote URLs your project can push to or pull from.

If you need to add a new remote, use:

git remote add origin <https://github.com/user/project.git>
Here, origin is just an alias for your remote. It’s not special, but it’s a common convention for the primary remote.

Once you’ve added a remote, Git knows where to send your code when you push it.

Alright, now that we’ve covered how to set up Git locally and connect it to a remote repository, let’s move on to how you actually start working with your code and tracking changes.
