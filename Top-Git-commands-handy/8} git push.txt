git push
To share your commits with others, you use:

git push
The git push command sends your commits from your local repository to a remote one, like GitHub or GitLab.

It’s how you sync your changes with the central project.

Here’s a basic example:

git push origin main
This command pushes your changes to the main branch of your remote repository. Now anyone else working on the project can see your updates.

Quick note: In most real-world projects, you don’t push directly to the main branch. Instead, you push to a separate feature branch, and then create a pull request or code review before merging into main.

Sometimes, when you're working on a project with others, someone else may have already pushed their changes before you.

That’s why, before you push your work, it’s a good idea to pull the latest changes so your local copy is up to date and you don’t accidentally overwrite someone else’s work.

To do that, we use git pull command.
