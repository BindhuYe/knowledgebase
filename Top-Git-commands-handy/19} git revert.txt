git revert
If you’ve already pushed a commit to a shared repository and need to undo something, git revert is the safer option.

Unlike git reset, which rewrites history, git revert preserves the history by creating a new commit that reverses the effects of a previous one.

Here’s how you use it:

git revert <commit-hash>
This doesn’t delete the original commit—it simply adds a new one that undoes the changes from that specific commit.

What if you only want to copy a specific commit from one branch to another without merging everything?

That’s where git cherry-pick command comes in.
