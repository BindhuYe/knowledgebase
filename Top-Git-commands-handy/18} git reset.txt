git reset
git reset is one of the most powerful commands for rolling back changes.

It moves the current branch’s HEAD pointer to a previous commit—essentially rewinding your project to an earlier state.

Depending on how much you want to undo, you can use git reset in three different ways:

Soft Reset
git reset --soft HEAD~1
Moves the HEAD back by one commit, but keeps all your changes staged.

Use this when you want to adjust a previous commit or fix a message.

Mixed Reset
git reset HEAD~1
Moves the HEAD back and unstages the changes, but keeps them in your working directory.

Perfect when you want to start over on staging but don’t want to lose your code.

Hard Reset
git reset --hard HEAD~1
This one completely wipes out changes in both the staging area and working directory.

Use it with caution as it permanently deletes uncommitted work.

If you’ve already pushed a commit to a shared repository and need to undo something, git revert is your safer bet.
