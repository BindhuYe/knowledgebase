git stash
Sometimes you’re in the middle of working on something and suddenly, you need to switch branches or handle a different task.

But your changes aren’t ready to commit yet.

You can use git stash command to temporarily save all your changes both staged and unstaged.

git stash
It’s like putting your work in a drawer so you can come back to it later.

When you're ready to pick up where you left off, just run:

git stash apply
This brings back your stashed changes while keeping the stash in case you need it again.

But, if you want to apply the stash and remove it at the same time, use:

git stash pop
Now, let’s say you've made a mistake and want to undo a commit or reset your branch.

That’s where git reset comes into play.
