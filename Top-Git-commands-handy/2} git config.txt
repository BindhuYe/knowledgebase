git config
This command lets you set your name and email so Git can tag each of your commits with your identity.

Here’s how to set it up:

git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
The --global flag means this configuration applies to all your Git projects.

But if you want to set a different name or email just for one project, you can run the same command without the --global flag, inside that project’s folder.

This step might seem small, but it’s actually very important, especially when you’re working in a team.

Git uses this information to track who made what change.

Now let’s say you’re not starting a new project locally. But, joining an existing one hosted on a remote repository, like Github.
