git diff
git diff gives you a line-by-line comparison between your working directory and the last commit.

git diff

It highlights what’s been added, removed, or modified so you know exactly what you’re about to commit.

You can also use git diff to compare changes between branches or specific commits:

git diff branch1..branch2
This shows what’s different between two branches—great for code reviews or deciding whether a branch is ready to merge.
