If you want to become a great developer, you need to master Git.

But, Git can feel confusing and overwhelming. With so many commands and options, it’s hard to know which ones actually matter.

In this article, I’ll walk you through the Top 20 Git Commands every developer should know.

These are the exact commands I’ve used again and again over the past 11 years as a programmer and they cover almost 99% of real-world Git use cases.


If you get comfortable with just these, you will be able to handle almost anything git related while working on projects.

Lets get started.

1. git init
Let’s start at the very beginning.

git init

This command turns a regular folder into a Git repository.

Behind the scenes, it creates a hidden .git folder.

This folder holds everything Git needs—your commit history, branches, logs, and all the metadata that powers version control.

You’ll typically use git init when starting a brand-new project from scratch.

Once you run git init, Git starts watching your files for changes.

From here on, you can commit changes, create branches, roll back mistakes, and more.

But before you start making commits, there’s one important thing you need to do: tell Git who you are.

That’s where git config comes in.
