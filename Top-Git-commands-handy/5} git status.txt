git status
If there’s one Git command you’ll find yourself using constantly, it’s this one:

git status
Think of it as your project’s dashboard—a quick snapshot of everything happening in your working directory.

Whenever you’re unsure about what’s changed, what’s staged, or what’s untracked, git status gives you the full picture.

It shows you:

Which files have changed and are staged for commit

Which files have changed but are not staged

Which files are untracked

Before committing anything, it’s a good habit to run git status.

It helps you decide what to stage, what to skip, and what needs attention.

Once you’ve reviewed the changes, your next step is usually to stage the right files using git add.
