When you’re working on a new feature or fixing a bug, it’s best to keep that work separate from the main codebase.

That’s where branches come in.

To create a new branch we simply run:

git branch new-feature
This creates a branch called new-feature , giving you a safe space where you can make changes without affecting the main branch.

Once you're done, you can merge your changes back into the main branch or open a pull request for review.

To see a list of all your local branches, just run:

git branch

The branch you’re currently on will be marked with an asterisk (*).

But if you have multiple branches…How do you switch between them?

That’s where git checkout command comes in.
