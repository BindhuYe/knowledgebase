git clone
In that case, you use the git clone command followed by the repository’s URL:

git clone <https://github.com/user/project.git>
This command does two things:

It downloads the entire project, including all files, folders, branches, and commit history—so you get a complete local copy.

It sets up a connection to the remote repository, so you can easily push your changes or pull updates from others.

Once cloned, you’re ready to start working on the project locally.

Now let’s imagine a different scenario: your local Git repository isn’t connected to any remote.

In that case, Git has no idea where to push your changes.

That’s where the git remote command comes in.
